//Question 4 - Filesystem & args

// Task: Implement the code as described in the main body,
// make sure to handle cases when the requested file is not found or the "files" directory doesn't exists and you have to create it
// Prefer modern solutions over classic C style solutions and keep in mind that this code should be able to run in other windows,
// linux and other platforms (hint: '/' and '\' in file paths)


#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{

    //If user passed "create" argument
    //		Create (or overwrite) a file named *argument2.txt*  with the text "Hello from *argument3*" in a folder named "files" under the current working directory
    //else if user passed "read" argument
    //		read a file named* argument2* from a folder named "files" under the current working directory and print it to the console

    //Execution example (assuming working directory c:\code): question04.exe create test1 Nir - should create the file c:\code\files\test1.txt with the content "Hello from Nir"
    //Execution example (assuming working directory c:\code): question04.exe read test1  - should print "Hello from Nir" in the console (assuming the previous command was executed)

    std::cout << "Press enter to exit" << std::endl;
    getchar();
    return 0;
